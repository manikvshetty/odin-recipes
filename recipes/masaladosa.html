            Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) separately and soak them in water for 6-8 hours.
        Grind them together to form a smooth batter. Add water as needed to get a slightly thick, but pourable consistency. Add salt and mix well.
        Leave the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><h5>For the Potato Filling:</h5>
        Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add cumin seeds, assafoetida, and curry leaves.
            Add chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.
            Add turmeric powder and mashed potatoes. Mix well. Season with salt and cook for a few more minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li><h5>For the Coconut Chutney:</h5>

        Blend together grated coconut, green chilies, ginger, coriander leaves, and salt with a little water to make a smooth chutney. Adjust consistency as desired.</li>
        <li><h5>For the Sambar:</h5>

            Pressure cook toor dal until soft. Mash it and set aside.
            In a large pot, heat oil. Add mustard seeds, curry leaves, chopped onions, and sauté until onions turn translucent.
            Add chopped tomatoes, sambar powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes turn soft.

    <li><h5>for making masaladosa</h5>
        Heat a non-stick dosa tava or griddle. Grease it lightly with oil.
        Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the tava and spread it in a circular motion to make a thin dosa.
        Drizzle a little oil around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden brown.
        Place a portion of the masala filling in the center of the dosa and fold it over.
